2. Calculate the Area of a Rectangle
mandatory
Objective: Use basic Python arithmetic operations and variable assignments to calculate the area of a rectangle using its length and width.

Task Description:

For this task, you are to write a Python script that calculates the area of a rectangle. The area of a rectangle is found by multiplying its length by its width.

Instructions:

Create a file named rectangle_area.py.
Define two variables in this file:
length with a value representing the length of the rectangle.
width with a value representing the width of the rectangle.
For simplicity, let’s use length = 10 and width = 5.
Calculate the area of the rectangle using the formula (Area = length × width) and store the result in a variable named area.
Print the calculated area in a format: The area of the rectangle is: [area].
Expected Output:

When executed, your script, with the provided values (length = 10 and width = 5), should print the area of the rectangle:

The area of the rectangle is: 50
'''

# Define the variables
length = 10
width = 5

# Calculate the area of the rectangle
area = length * width

# Print the result
print("The area of the rectangle is:", area)
